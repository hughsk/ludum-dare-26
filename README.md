# ludum-dare-26 #

This is my submission for [Ludum Dare #26](http://ludumdare.com/compo), with
the theme *minimalism*. The game's called *grow.* I'll leave you to work out
the rest.

You can play it [here](http://hughsk.github.io/ludum-dare-26)! Currently
only been tested on Chrome, but I will be making sure it works at least on
Firefox.
